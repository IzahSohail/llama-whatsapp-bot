Our listings are carefully curated, with a strong focus on high-growth areas and quality developments. Currently, we specialize exclusively in off-plan properties and do not deal in rentals or secondary market listings.  What are off-plan properties?  An off-plan property is a property that is still under construction or hasn't begun construction yet. You purchase the property based on plans and architectural designs provided by the developer. What are the benefits of buying off-plan properties? There are several reasons why investors and individuals may consider buying off-plan properties including the potentially lower initial costs, flexibility in payment terms as well as the potential for higher returns and rental yields.   Are there any risks involved with off-plan properties?  As with any investment anywhere in the world, there are potential risks that you must be aware of such as construction delays, market price fluctuations, and the developers' reputation. Despite these risks, the UAE market is well-regulated and has established itself as one of the most reputable and reliable markets.   How do I know the property listings on Siraa are verified?
